This could very well be the world's first Vietnamese Scrabble-type game. Whether you're a Vietnamese language learner or a native speaker, Vietboard provides endless crosswording fun for everyone. You can play the game online by clicking the big button below or download the game and open *play\index.html* in your browser.

Vietboard is still in early beta, so we are actively looking for players to help us fine-tune the game balance. We'd love to hear from you, so drop by our (Facebook Page)[https://fb.me/vietboardplay] and join a new community of word game fans.

Enjoy! ^^
