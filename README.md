# Vietboard - Ô Chữ Tiếng Việt

This is a Vietnamese Scrabble-type word game implemented in pure JavaScript and played against the computer with a very fast engine. You can [play the game online](https://www.vietboard.org/play/) or download the code and open *index.html* in your browser.

The code comprises an engine (*engine.js*) that does the game logic and a user interface (*ui.js*) that renders the board and manages user interactions. This design allows one to easily create alternative user interfaces. The code is also designed to be easily localized to other languages.

The fast game play is made possible by leveraging Regular Expressions to conduct searches. The current UI makes use of the excellent [REDIPS.drag](https://github.com/dbunic/REDIPS_drag) drag-and-drop library. Other credits go to [Hồ Ngọc Đức](https://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/~duc/software/misc/wordlist.html) for the original 22K word list (continuously being updated) and [VDict](https://vdict.com/) for the word definitions.
